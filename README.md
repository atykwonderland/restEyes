A very minimal AutoHotKey program to run in the background when looking at a monitor for prolonged periods of time.
This program follows the doctor recommended 20-20-20 rule when looking at a monitor to optimise eye health while using a computer. 

Turn on and off using the button on the gui once executing the program.
Exit the program using the window close.

20-20-20 explained:
The rule says that for every 20 minutes spent looking at a screen, a person should look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.
Following the rule is a great way to remember to take frequent breaks. This should reduce eye strain caused by looking at digital screens for too long.
